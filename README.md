# Assets

## APIs 
In assembling this project we used two free, open access API's.

    - News API: https://newsapi.org/
    
    - National Weather Service API: https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api

## CSS Framework + Style 
    - For styling and layout, we utilized Bulma (bulma.io) for elements, components, and forms. We utilized Bulma columns throughout the site to provide dynamic layout.   

    - Additional icon and banner png and gif files were created using Canva.com

# Planning and Wireframe
![Wireframe](assets/Wireframe.png)

The team divided the project by website section (headlines, weather, newsletter), and segmented the site into flexible, Bulma containers of 100% width to help assure our respective work did not crowd into or create errors in other sections.
